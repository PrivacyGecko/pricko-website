## 5. Utility-First Framing Guidelines

### 5.1 Always Lead with Utility

**DO**:
1. Describe what the token DOES
2. Explain functional benefits
3. Show how it integrates with products
4. Highlight specific use cases

**DON'T**:
1. Lead with token economics
2. Focus on scarcity or supply limits
3. Emphasize secondary market trading
4. Discuss price history or predictions

### 5.2 Example: Good vs. Bad Framing

**❌ BAD** (Investment-Focused):
```
"PRICK has a limited supply of 1 billion tokens, with 40% available for public
sale. Early buyers benefit from the lowest prices before the token lists on major
exchanges. With strong fundamentals and a growing ecosystem, PRICK represents a
compelling investment opportunity in the privacy sector."
```

**✅ GOOD** (Utility-Focused):
```
"PRICK tokens provide functional access to Privacy Gecko's 8-product ecosystem.
Token holders can unlock premium features in GeckoShare, GeckoView, and other tools,
participate in governance decisions, and access discounted service pricing. The token
serves as a unified access key across all Privacy Gecko services."
```

### 5.3 Product Integration Language

When describing how tokens work with products:

**Template**:
```
[Product Name] offers both free and premium tiers. Premium features require either
a monthly subscription ($[X]) or holding [Y] PRICK tokens in your wallet. Token holders
gain perpetual access without recurring fees, plus additional benefits like [specific feature].
```

**Example**:
```
GeckoShare offers both free and premium tiers. Premium features require either a
monthly subscription ($9.99) or holding 10,000 PRICK tokens in your wallet. Token
holders gain perpetual access without recurring fees, plus additional benefits like
unlimited file size and persistent vault storage.
```

## 6. Securities Law Compliance

### 6.1 Howey Test Avoidance

The Howey Test determines if something is a security. To avoid classification:

**Criteria 1: Investment of Money**
- ✅ Frame as "purchase of utility," not "investment"
- ✅ Use language: "acquire," "obtain," "purchase for use"
- ❌ Avoid: "invest," "invest in," "capital contribution"

**Criteria 2: Common Enterprise**
- ✅ Emphasize decentralized governance
- ✅ Highlight community-driven development
- ❌ Avoid: "team will increase value," "company profits"

**Criteria 3: Expectation of Profits**
- ✅ Focus on utility value and service access
- ✅ Describe functional benefits only
- ❌ Avoid: "profit from price increase," "returns," "appreciation"

**Criteria 4: Efforts of Others**
- ✅ Emphasize token holder governance and participation
- ✅ Describe ecosystem as community-driven
- ❌ Avoid: "team will make you money," "sit back and profit"

### 6.2 Safe Harbor Compliance Checklist

For each piece of content, verify:

- [ ] No promise or expectation of profit
- [ ] No reliance on efforts of others for value increase
- [ ] Utility clearly described and functional
- [ ] Token used for access, governance, or services
- [ ] No investment-related language

### 7.2 European Union (MiCA Regulation)

**Key Requirements**:
- Consumer protection disclosures
- Clear risk warnings
- Transparent fee structures
- Right to information

**Approved Language**:

the lawfulness of token acquisition in any specific jurisdiction.
