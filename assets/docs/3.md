### Roadmap Page Content

**Pricko.com /roadmap should show:**
```

Same timeline, different emphasis. Both accurate.

### Cross-Referencing

**Product pages should link to roadmap:**

// If product is "Coming 2025"
<div className="launch-info">
  <p>Launching Q2 2025</p>
  <a href="/roadmap">View full roadmap →</a>
</div>

// If product is "Live"
<div className="launch-info">
  <p>✓ Launched Q4 2024</p>
  <a href="/roadmap">See what's coming next →</a>
</div>
```

**Roadmap should link to product pages:**
```tsx

</a>
```

## 📝 Usage Guidelines

### Implementation Checklist

**When adding products to your site:**

1. **Copy entire product section** from this document
2. **Verify status badge** is current (Live/Beta/In Review/Coming 2025)
3. **Include token utility section** to encourage token holding
4. **Add "Learn More" CTA** linking to full product page
5. **Keep pricing current** - check against shared-data.json
6. **Include platform badges** (Web/iOS/Android/etc.)
7. **Test all links** before publishing

### Updating Products

**When product status changes:**

1. Update this master document FIRST
2. Then update both Pricko.com and PrivacyGecko.com
3. Update shared-data.json
4. Run audit agent to verify consistency
5. Announce update in changelog

**Never update a product description on just one site - always update both simultaneously.**
