# Privacy Gecko Brand Guidelines

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** Official Brand Standards

---

## 🦎 Brand Overview

**Brand Name:** Privacy Gecko  
**Token Name:** $PRICKO  
**Tagline:** Privacy with a bite  
**Mission:** Making privacy tools accessible to everyone through blockchain technology

### Brand Architecture

```
PRIVACY GECKO
(Main Brand / Platform)
        ↓
  $PRICKO TOKEN
  (Utility Layer)
        ↓
GECKO TOOLS SUITE
(Products & Services)
```

**Key Principle:** Privacy Gecko is the platform. $PRICKO is the token that powers it. All tools use "Gecko[Tool]" naming.

---

## 📛 Naming Conventions

### ✅ CORRECT Naming

**Main Brand:**
- Privacy Gecko (full name)
- Gecko (short reference)
- Privacy Gecko ecosystem

**Token:**
- $PRICKO (always with $ symbol in marketing)
- PRICKO token
- $PRICKO utility token

**Products - ALWAYS use "Gecko[Tool]" format:**
- GeckoShare
- GeckoGuard
- GeckoShell
- GeckoVPN
- BurnerChat (exception - standalone product name)
- DoxxGuard (exception - standalone product name)
- GeckoAdvisor
- GeckoLock
- GeckoView
- GeckoWatch

**Why BurnerChat and DoxxGuard don't have "Gecko" prefix:**
- These names are already descriptive and memorable
- Adding "Gecko" would make them too long
- They still visually carry gecko branding in logos/design

### ❌ INCORRECT Naming

Never use:
- ~~PrickoShare~~ → GeckoShare
- ~~PrickoGuard~~ → GeckoGuard
- ~~PrickoShell~~ → GeckoShell
- ~~PrickoBrowser~~ → GeckoShell
- ~~The Pricko token~~ → $PRICKO or PRICKO token
- ~~Privacy Gecko token~~ → $PRICKO (token has its own name)

---

## 🎨 Visual Identity

### Logo Usage

**Primary Logo:** Privacy Gecko wordmark with gecko icon  
**Token Logo:** $PRICKO with gecko mascot

```

**Typography:**

```
Headlines: Inter Bold / 700

```

## 💬 Messaging Framework

### Core Messages (Use Consistently)

**What is Privacy Gecko?**
> "Privacy Gecko is a suite of privacy-first tools powered by the $PRICKO utility token. From encrypted file sharing to secure browsing, we make privacy accessible to everyone."

**What is $PRICKO?**
> "$PRICKO is a Solana-based utility token that powers the Privacy Gecko ecosystem. Hold tokens to unlock premium features, vote on governance proposals, and access exclusive tools."

**Why Privacy Gecko?**
> "Because privacy should be easy, not complicated. We're building tools that protect your data without requiring a PhD in cryptography."

**Fair Launch Promise:**
> "No presale, no private investors. 80% of $PRICKO supply goes directly to the liquidity pool on pump.fun for a fair launch."

**Not Staking, Not Revenue Share:**
> "Hold $PRICKO tokens to unlock features, not to earn passive income. This is utility, not investment."

---

## 📅 Roadmap Guidelines

### Roadmap Requirements (Both Sites)

**MUST be present on:**
- ✅ Pricko.com (token-focused roadmap)
- ✅ PrivacyGecko.com (product-focused roadmap)

**Missing roadmap = massive trust issue**
- Token buyers need to see what they're investing in
- Shows long-term vision vs. pump-and-dump
- Proves consistent development

### Core Principles

**Same Timeline:**
- Both sites show identical quarters (Q4 2024 - Q4 2025)
- Same product launch dates
- Same milestone completion status
- Same founding date

**Different Emphasis:**

**Pricko.com (Token Focus):**
- "Q1 2025: $PRICKO Token Launch → Governance activated"
- "Q2 2025: GeckoVPN live → 25K+ holders get 50% discount"
- Show token utility for each milestone
- Emphasize "when features unlock"
- Include token holder benefit summaries
- Link to tokenomics and pump.fun

**PrivacyGecko.com (Product Focus):**
- "Q1 2025: GeckoGuard Public Launch → Advanced tracker blocking"
- "Q2 2025: GeckoVPN with 45+ countries → No-logs policy"
- Show product features and capabilities
- Emphasize "what tools can do"
- Include technical specifications
- Link to product pages and docs

### Visual Consistency

**Both sites should have:**
- Timeline visualization (can be vertical or horizontal)
- Status indicators (✓ Completed, ⚡ In Progress, 🚀 Planned)
- Quarter breakdown cards
- Milestone descriptions
- CTA to related pages

**Design can differ:**
- Pricko: Can be more animated, crypto-aesthetic
- PrivacyGecko: Can be more professional, clean

### Content Structure

**Each Quarter Must Include:**
```markdown
## Q[X] 202[X]
Status: [Completed | In Progress | Planned]

### Milestone 1: [Product/Feature Name]
Description: [What is launching]

// Pricko emphasis:
Token Utility: [How token holders benefit]

// PrivacyGecko emphasis:
Key Features: [What the product does]
```

### Update Protocol

**When a milestone completes:**
1. Update shared-data.json first
2. Change status in both sites simultaneously
3. Add completion date
4. Update homepage hero if major milestone
5. Announce on social media
6. Run audit agent to verify sync

**When dates change:**
1. Update shared-data.json
2. Communicate reason (transparent)
3. Update both sites same day
4. Notify community (Twitter, Telegram)
5. Document in changelog

### Cross-Linking Strategy

**Pricko.com roadmap should link to:**
- Product pages on PrivacyGecko.com (for details)
- Tokenomics page (explain utility)
- pump.fun (for launch info)
- About page (team behind roadmap)

**PrivacyGecko.com roadmap should link to:**
- Pricko.com tokenomics (token benefits)
- Individual product pages (deep dives)
- About page (team behind roadmap)
- Contact/waitlist (sign up for updates)

### Roadmap Red Flags (Avoid)

❌ **Never:**
- Show different launch dates on different sites
- Overpromise and under-deliver
- Miss milestones without communication
- Have roadmap on one site but not the other
- Make dates too specific ("Launch Jan 15" vs "Launch Q1")
- Show completed items as "coming soon"

✅ **Always:**
- Use quarters not exact dates (flexibility)
- Update both sites when status changes
- Be transparent about delays
- Show what's already delivered (proof)
- Include realistic timelines
- Cross-link between sites

### Roadmap Messaging Examples

**Pricko.com Style:**
```
Q2 2025: Token Utility Explosion 🚀

• GeckoVPN Launch
  → Hold 25K+ $PRICKO for 50% lifetime discount

• BurnerChat Beta  
  → Hold 8K+ $PRICKO for extended room retention

• Token-Gated Features Activate
  → All existing tools unlock premium benefits
```

**PrivacyGecko.com Style:**
```
Q2 2025: Expanding the Privacy Suite

• GeckoVPN Launch
  → 45+ countries, WireGuard protocol, no-logs policy
  → Kill switch and split tunneling included

• BurnerChat Beta
  → Temporary encrypted messaging, self-destructing rooms
  → Screenshot detection and burn-after-reading

• Enhanced Tool Integration
  → Seamless experience across all products
```

Same milestones, different angles. Both accurate, both compelling.

### Trust-Building Elements

**Include on roadmap pages:**
- Completed milestones (with ✓ checkmarks)
- "In Progress" transparency
- Founder commitment statement
- Link to GitHub/development activity
- Community involvement opportunities
- Beta tester testimonials for completed items

**Avoid on roadmap pages:**
- Overly aggressive timelines
- Features without clear utility
- Vague "TBA" dates for everything
- No proof of past delivery
- Unrealistic scope ("10 tools in 1 month")

## 📝 Content Style Guide

### Language Guidelines

**✅ DO:**
- Use active voice ("Protect your privacy" not "Privacy is protected")
- Keep sentences short and scannable
- Use "you" and "your" (conversational)
- Explain technical terms simply
- Bold key facts for scannability
- Use lists and bullets for clarity

**❌ DON'T:**
- Use jargon without explanation
- Promise guaranteed returns or profits
- Make unverifiable security claims
- Use all caps (except $PRICKO in specific contexts)
- Use excessive exclamation marks!!!
- Sound like a robot ("We are pleased to announce...")

### Token-Related Language

**✅ Safe Language:**
- "Utility token"
- "Powers the ecosystem"
- "Unlock features"
- "Governance rights"
- "May fluctuate in value"
- "Not financial advice"

**❌ Avoid (Regulatory Risk):**
- ~~"Investment opportunity"~~
- ~~"Guaranteed returns"~~
- ~~"Passive income"~~
- ~~"To the moon"~~
- ~~"Get rich"~~
- ~~"Dividends"~~
- ~~"Profit sharing"~~

### Privacy-First Language

**When discussing privacy:**
- Emphasize user control
- Be specific about what data is/isn't collected
- Explain encryption simply
- Acknowledge trade-offs honestly
- Focus on benefits, not fear

**Example:**
❌ "The internet is watching you! Be afraid!"  
✅ "Your browsing data is valuable. We help you keep it private."

## 🔐 Mandatory Disclaimers

### Token Disclaimer (Required on ALL token-related pages)

```
⚠️ Important: $PRICKO is a utility token, not an investment vehicle. 
Purchasing tokens does not constitute an investment contract. Token 
value may fluctuate. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. 
This is not financial advice.
```

**Placement:** 
- Bottom of token pages
- Near "Buy" CTAs
- In footer of Pricko.com

### Product Status Labels

Use consistent status badges:
- **Live** - Available now for all users
- **Beta** - Limited testing, may have bugs
- **In Review** - Pending approval (e.g., browser extensions)
- **Coming 2025** - In development, not yet available

---

## 🌐 Cross-Site Consistency Rules

### Data That MUST Match Exactly

These must be **identical** on both Pricko.com and PrivacyGecko.com:

1. **Product names** - Always "Gecko[Tool]" format
2. **Product descriptions** - Word-for-word match
3. **Token info** - Tokenomics, supply, blockchain
4. **Founder information** - Names, roles, bios
5. **Contact info** - Emails, social links
6. **Legal disclaimers** - Token warnings, privacy policies
7. **Roadmap dates** - Launch dates, quarters, milestones
8. **Product status** - Live/Beta/In Review/Coming 2025
9. **Feature lists** - Exactly same features per product
10. **Founding date** - 2024, not 2025

### Site-Specific Differences (Acceptable)

**Pricko.com can:**
- Focus more on token utility
- Use crypto-native memes/language
- Emphasize community and governance
- Link to DEXs and trading platforms

**PrivacyGecko.com can:**
- Focus more on product features
