### Phase 2: Synthesis & Prioritization (Days 4-5)
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING - Awaiting agent reports
**Owner**: Orchestrator

**Activities**:
1. **Consolidate Findings**
   - Aggregate all agent reports
   - Cross-reference overlapping issues
   - Identify synergies and conflicts

2. **Create Unified Priority Matrix**
   ```
   Priority | Impact | Effort | Domain | Issues
   ---------|--------|--------|--------|-------
   P0       | High   | Any    | All    | List
   P1       | High   | Low    | All    | List
   P2       | Medium | Low    | All    | List
   P3       | Low    | Low    | All    | List
   ```

3. **Map Dependencies**
   - Sequential fixes (must be done in order)
   - Parallel fixes (can be done simultaneously)
   - Blocking issues (prevent other work)

4. **Estimate Implementation Effort**
   - Small (1-4 hours)
   - Medium (4-8 hours)
   - Large (8+ hours)

5. **Calculate ROI**
   - Impact × Urgency / Effort = Priority Score
   - Focus on high-ROI items first

**Deliverable**: ORCHESTRATOR-SYNTHESIS-REPORT-[DATE].md

---

### Phase 3: Implementation (Days 6-12)
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING
**Owner**: Orchestrator + Web Developer Agent (as needed)

**Workflow**:
1. **Parallel Track**: Independent fixes across domains
   - UX improvements that don't affect branding
   - Brand enhancements that don't affect UX
   - Legal updates that are standalone

2. **Sequential Track**: Interdependent fixes
   - CTA copy changes (Brand writes → UX reviews → Legal approves)
   - Disclaimer updates (Legal writes → Brand reviews → UX places)
   - Content changes (Brand writes → Legal reviews → UX verifies)

3. **Quality Gates**:
   - Each agent approves changes in their domain
   - Orchestrator verifies no conflicts
   - Final agent re-review before deployment

**Execution Pattern**:
```
[P0 Issues] → Immediate attention
  ↓
[P1 Issues] → High ROI quick wins
  ↓
[P2 Issues] → Medium priority improvements
  ↓
[P3 Issues] → Nice-to-haves (if time permits)
```

---

### Phase 4: Validation & Sign-off (Days 13-14)

**Activities**:
1. **Cross-Agent Review**
   - UX Agent: Verify all changes maintain usability
   - Brand Agent: Verify all changes maintain brand voice
   - Legal Agent: Verify all changes maintain compliance

2. **Regression Testing**
   - No new issues introduced
   - Previous 18 fixes still intact
   - All pages work as expected

3. **Final Orchestrator Approval**
   - All agents have signed off
   - No critical issues remain
   - Launch readiness confirmed

4. **Documentation**
   - Update README.md
   - Update CLAUDE.md
   - Create CHANGELOG.md
   - Archive agent reports

**Deliverable**: FINAL-VALIDATION-REPORT-[DATE].md

## CONFLICT RESOLUTION FRAMEWORK

### Agent Disagreement Protocol

**Scenario 1: UX vs Brand**
- **Example**: UX wants shorter copy, Brand wants more personality
- **Resolution**:
  1. Gather both perspectives with data
  2. Test user comprehension (UX) vs brand recall (Brand)
  3. Prioritize based on page goal (conversion vs brand building)
  4. Orchestrator makes final call with rationale
  5. Document decision for future reference

**Scenario 2: Brand vs Legal**
- **Example**: Brand wants bold claims, Legal flags risk
- **Resolution**:
  1. Legal agent quantifies risk level (1-10)
  2. Brand agent quantifies brand impact (1-10)
  3. If legal risk >7: Legal wins (compliance is non-negotiable)
  4. If legal risk <7: Explore compromise language
  5. Orchestrator mediates middle ground

**Scenario 3: UX vs Legal**
- **Example**: Legal wants prominent disclaimers, UX says they hurt conversion
- **Resolution**:
  1. Legal identifies minimum compliance requirements
  2. UX proposes compliant alternatives (modals, tooltips, etc.)
  3. Test multiple approaches if possible
  4. Legal must approve final implementation
  5. Conversion tracking post-launch

### Decision-Making Authority

**Orchestrator Makes Final Call When**:
- Agents cannot reach consensus
- Trade-offs involve multiple domains
- Strategic direction is unclear
- Timeline pressure requires decision

**Escalate to Human When**:
- Legal risk >8/10
- Major strategic direction change
- Budget/resource constraints
- Security incidents
- Agent consensus is "needs human judgment"

### Issue Tracking

**Format**:
```markdown
## ISSUE: [ISSUE-ID]
**Severity**: Critical/High/Medium/Low
**Domain**: UX/Brand/Legal/Cross-cutting

```

---

### Agent-to-Agent Communication

**Process**:
1. Agent flags cross-domain issue in their report
2. Orchestrator creates coordination ticket
3. Affected agents discuss in coordinated thread
4. Orchestrator facilitates resolution
5. Decision documented in master log

**Example**:
```markdown
## COORDINATION TICKET: CT-001
**Issue**: CTA copy effectiveness vs legal risk
**Agents Involved**: Brand Agent, Legal Agent, UX Agent
**Initiated By**: Brand Agent

**Brand Position**: "Join the Gecko Army Before Launch" is engaging
**Legal Position**: "Before Launch" implies time pressure (securities risk)
**UX Position**: Current CTA has good visibility, any change needs testing

**Orchestrator Resolution**:
- Remove "Before Launch" (legal risk mitigation)
- Change to "Join the Gecko Army - 1.2K+ Members"
- Adds social proof (UX benefit)
- Maintains brand voice (Brand approval)
- All agents approve

**Status**: RESOLVED
```
