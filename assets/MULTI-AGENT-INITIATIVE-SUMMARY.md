- Test user comprehension vs brand recall
- Orchestrator makes final call with rationale

**Brand vs Legal**:
- Legal risk >7/10: Legal wins (compliance non-negotiable)
- Legal risk <7/10: Explore compromise language
- Orchestrator mediates middle ground

**UX vs Legal**:
- Legal identifies minimum compliance requirements
- UX proposes compliant alternatives (modals, tooltips)
- Test multiple approaches if possible
- Legal must approve final implementation
